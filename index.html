  <p>
    Hello everyone, my name is Merit Okafor. A law graduate of Nnamdi Azikiwe Uuniversity, Awka.
    I graduated in the year 2016, went to law school and was called to the Nigerian bar in 2017.
    I have been practicing law since then. I am a very curious person, who loves to acquire knowledge and
    apply the skills learnt in solving real life problems. <br> <br> Despite being a lawyer I have always had this
    strong bias for technolgy. We all know how science and technolgy has really helped the world
    advance in amazing ways, consequent upon this, I decided to learn programming/coding, understand how machine
    learning and artificial intelligence works inorder to apply the knowledge in solving real human legal problems. <br>
    <br>I understand that legal applications can be developed, trained/taught with machine learning, to profer
    legal advice to clients based on their request and interest. For instance, a foreigner who wants to incoporate a
    company in Nigeria
    can just use these legal applications to research on the steps and documents they require to incorporate a company
    in Nigeria. The app can give them a document checklist and probably review the documents provided to ensure
    that they are the perfect fit. <br> <br> There are lots of ways technology can be applied to the practice of law, to
    reduce
    human error and stress, enhance quality control in contract documentation, predict the final outcome of a suit based
    on judicial precedents and statutory provisions.
    The applications can also be programmed in a way that it keeps track of all the firms debtors, sends them fee notes
    and payment reminders automatically.
    <br>Thus, the benefits that will be derived from a marriage amoung law and technology cannot be overemphasized.
    <br> <br> All these benefits and more has motivated me in taking a course in computer programming. A big shout out
    to the team at Capacity Bay, who have devoted their time and resources in training myself and others at large.
